# Coalescence in Two-Sex Branching Processes

This repository contains the **LaTeX manuscript of Python code** for the research study **"Coalescence in Two-Sex Branching Processes."** The code used in simulations is included.
## About the Project

This research explores the **coalescence phenomenon** in discrete-time two-sex branching processes. The study investigates:
- **Three coalescence types:** Along male lineage, female lineage, and both combined.
- **Two mating mechanisms:** Deterministic (fixed offspring) and Random mating.
- **Mathematical modeling and simulations** for probability distributions of coalescence times.
